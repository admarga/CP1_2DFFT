# Repository to demonstrate 2D FFTs
This project aims to demonstrate the power of 2D FFT for image manipulation.

Using a filters in the Frequency domain preiodic structures in the original image can be enhanced or removed.

## Project structure

Pictures should live in the data folder.
Libraries for manipulating data should live in the UtilityFunctions Folder.
